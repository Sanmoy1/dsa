Q1. He asked me about heap first and how heapify works and how will I implement the heap.

Answer:
We generally use heap when we are asked to find the kth largest or kth smallest element in an array in O(1) (constant) time.
If we want to add the element in O(logn) time and remove the element in O(logn) time then we use heap.
